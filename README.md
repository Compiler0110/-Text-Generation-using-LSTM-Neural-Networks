# -Text-Generation-using-LSTM-Neural-Networks
Generate text using LSTM neural networks. Read data from Word documents, tokenize, and train the model. More documents improve accuracy. LSTM model predicts next word based on context. Generated text is coherent and contextually relevan


The text data is then tokenized using the Tokenizer class from the Keras library, which converts the text into sequences of integers. These sequences are used to train the LSTM model. The code creates input sequences for the model by generating n-grams, sequences of adjacent words. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words.

The LSTM model architecture consists of an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, a dropout layer for regularization, and a dense layer with a softmax activation function for output. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

Once the model is compiled, it is trained on the input sequences. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence based on the context provided by the preceding words. After training, the model can generate new text based on a given seed text.

The generated text demonstrates the model's ability to understand and generate coherent text based on the patterns learned during training. The accuracy of the generated text depends on several factors, including the size and quality of the training data, the model architecture, and the training duration. With more diverse training data and careful tuning of hyperparameters, the model can generate more accurate and contextually relevant text.
